# Pomodoro Timer

This project is part of the Free Code Camp's front-end development certification. The user stories required are:

1. User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
2. User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
3. User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
