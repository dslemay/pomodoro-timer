# Pomodoro Timer

This project is part of the Free Code Camp's front-end development certification. The user stories required are:

1. User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
2. User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
3. User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

I decided to build this project in React due to the state management and reusability of the components which I took advantage of with the timer counters. This project uses states and props judiciously, as well as the React lifecycle hooks to take advantage of when to automatically switch timers, play a gong sound when the timer completes, etc.
